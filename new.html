          <br />
          In the quiet echoes of a caring heart,<br />
          Priya, a gem, played a special part.<br />
          She shed her habits, changed her ways,<br />
          Learned Web-Dev, a delightful phase.<br />
          <br />
          Worries for marks, a shared concern,<br /> 
          Her dedication, a lesson to learn.<br />
          "Stay online," I asked one day,<br />
          She asked her dad, work kept at bay.<br />
          <br />
          I couldn't fathom such care so pure,<br />
          Efforts she gives, of that, I'm sure.<br />
          But in my heart, a whispering doubt,<br />
          Do I deserve, this care throughout?<br />
          <br />
          Priya, my treasure, in your warmth I find,<br />
          A care so selfless, one of a kind.<br />
          Yet in my thoughts, a humble plea,<br />
          Do I merit what you give to me?<br />
          <br />
          So on this rose day, let's celebrate,<br />
          A friendship cherished, never to abate.<br />
          With roses red, our bond's pure hue,<br />
          Priya, my gem, I'm grateful for you.<br />
          <br />
